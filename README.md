# CresskillGuessr 📍 
CresskillGuessr for AP CSA Final Project

CresskillGuessr is a web-based game where players have to guess the location of various places in CHS. The objective is to guess the correct locations within 3 strikes to get 5 right.

Our Motivation for CresskillGuessr was inspired for our shared love of the game Geoguessr. Geoguessr is an online game that tests your geographic knowledge by placing you in a random location anyhwere in the world using Google Maps Street View. We took that objective and combined it with locations that CHS students would be very familiar with, CHS itself. Although we ran into problems that forced us to strive away from our original design and tested our perserverance as AP CSA students, Cresskillguessr succeeded in giving us a fun challenge that wrapped up our year in this one project.
