# CresskillGuessr
CresskillGuessr for AP CSA Final Project

CresskillGuessr is a web-based game where players have to guess the location of various places in CHS. The objective is to guess the correct locations within 3 strikes to get 5 right.

Our Motivation for CresskillGuessr was inspired for our shared love of the game Geoguessr. Geoguessr is an online game that tests your geographic knowledge by placing you in a random location anyhwere in the world using Google Maps Street View. We took that objective and combined it with locations that CHS students would be very familiar with, CHS itself. Although we ran into problems that forced us to strive away from our original design and tested our perserverance as AP CSA students, Cresskillguessr succeeded in giving us a fun challenge that wrapped up our year in this one project. 

## How to Play

1. Start a New Game:
   - Click on the "Start New Game" button on the start screen.

2. Guess the Location:
   - An image of a place in CHS will be displayed on the left side.
   - Enter your guess in the text input field on the right side.
   - Click the "Guess" button or press Enter to check your guess.

3. Scoring and Strikes:
   - If your guess is correct, your score will increase by 1.
   - If your guess is incorrect, you will receive a strike.
   - The game allows a maximum of 3 strikes.
   - The goal is to achieve a score of 5 without reaching the maximum strikes.

4. Game Over:
   - The game ends in two scenarios:
     - If you reach a score of 5, you win the game.
     - If you receive 3 strikes, the game is over.
   - In both cases, the game over screen will be displayed, showing your final score.
